**Última actualización: 13 de enero de 2026**

If your newly created WhatsApp Business Account (WABA) is stuck in **Pending**, you won't be able to link your number to MEGA.

The most common reason for this issue is **incomplete Business Portfolio information** inside Meta Business Manager — especially the **business website**, which Meta uses to validate your business identity.

This article explains how to fix it quickly.

## Why Your WABA Shows "Pending"

When you create a WABA, Meta checks your business information. If the required fields aren't complete — especially your **website URL** — Meta cannot verify your business and will keep the WABA in **Pending** status.

Your website is one of the strongest signals Meta uses to confirm that your business is legitimate.

## How to Fix the "Pending" Status

To solve the issue, you must update your **Business Portfolio** inside Meta Business Manager → Business Info, **not inside MEGA**.

Follow these steps:

### 1. Go to Your Business Portfolio

From your Meta Business Manager:

**Business Settings → Business Info → Business details**

### 2. Update All Required Business Details

Fill in or update:

- **Business Name**
- **Legal Name** (if applicable)
- **Business Category**
- **Business Description**
- **Business Address**
- **Business Phone Number**
- **Business Website** (very important)

⚠️ **Meta uses your website as one of the key elements to validate the business.**

If you do not have a website, you may use the link of your Facebook or Instagram business page.

### 3. Save and Refresh the WhatsApp Manager Page

After updating the information:

1. **Save changes**
2. Go to **WhatsApp Accounts → Overview**
3. **Refresh the page**
4. Wait a few moments for the status to update

In most cases, the WABA status switches from **Pending → Approved** within minutes.

### 4. If Still Pending, Re-create the WABA

If after updating your website and business info the status doesn't change:

1. **Remove the WABA**
2. **Create a new one**
3. Meta will validate the updated business information immediately

This resolves nearly all persistent Pending cases.

### 5. Contact Meta Support (Optional)

If your WABA is still pending after several hours, contact Meta Business Support and mention:

> **Note**  
> "My WABA is stuck in Pending. I have updated my Business Portfolio with a valid website. Please review."

## When Can You Link Your Number to MEGA?

Once your WABA shows as **Approved** inside WhatsApp Manager, you can go back to MEGA and connect your number normally.

**Check status here:**

Meta Business Manager → WhatsApp Manager → Overview
